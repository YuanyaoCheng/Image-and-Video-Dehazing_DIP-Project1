File homomorphic_filter.py: This file includes the algorithm for homomorphic filtering to process images.
File evaluate.py: This file contains methods for evaluating the quality of dehazed images.
File video dehazing.py: This file holds the algorithm for video dehazing using the Dark Channel Prior method.
File video dehazing iterating.py: This file presents an algorithm for video dehazing using an iterative approach with the Dark Channel Prior.
